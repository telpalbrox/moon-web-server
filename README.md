# Moon web server
Toy HTTP server written in rust for fun and educational purposes.

I'm trying to write everything from scratch using as a base the final code from [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

Of course is completly unfinished, and shouln't be used for anything, just for fun.
